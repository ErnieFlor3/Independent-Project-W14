# Independent-Project-W14


New Project with implementation of sorting algorithms

In this project, the main objective was demonstrating the use of two classic sorting algorithms with Merge Sort and Quick Sort and heap sort, to be able to use in sorting financial situations. 

The program is meant t simulate a basic banking log system. 
In this, the user can view a sample transaction list and sort it by amount through merge sort, by date through quick sort, and by type through heap sort. 

TO RUN
 make sure to have compiler (g++)
 g++ -std=c++11 -o sorting
 

 then input run instructions
 ./sorting
